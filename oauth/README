This is not a complete implementation of the OAuth protocol. Instead this module provides persistence for OAuth
provider records and for authorized OAuth tokens on behalf of individual CLE users. This module was originally
created to support the Google Docs integration into Resources (rsmart/google-content). Since Google's Java Client
Library provides an implementation of the OAuth protocol specific to working with Google, the work of implementing the
protocol in this module was put off for later work. At some point it probably makes sense to embed a third-party
library in this module - perhaps even Google's - or to combine the code use in the BLTI module to centralize OAuth
concerns.

This module currently supplies a service available to any other tool which might need to create or find OAuth provider
records or OAuth tokens. OAuth provider records provide the URLs and security tokens needed to communicate with the
server side in OAuth transactions. OAuth tokens are used to formulate requests on behalf of a user with an OAuth
provider. For example, an OAuth provider record for Flickr would include the URLs for creating OAuth tokens with
Flickr and for obtaining Flickr resources for a user. A user who wants to access his or her content from Sakai would
create an OAuth token which would be stored by the OAuthTokenService in this module.

Two tools are supplied by this module: OAuth Provider Tool and OAuth Token Tool. The OAuth Provider Tool allows a CLE
administrator to create, edit or delete OAuth Provider records. The OAuth Token Tool allows a user to delete his or her
OAuth tokens thereby revoking Sakai's access to the user's content held by an OAuth Provider. The OAuth Provider Tool
should be available in the administrator workspace only. The OAuth Token Tool should be available in MyWorkspace.

The file rsmart/oauth/INSTALL describes the steps for installing this module into Sakai and registering the two
provided tools.
