osp 2.0 database structure

forms
-----
osp_structured_artifact_def contains form definitions including a copy of the xsd - this table is called metaobj_form_def
user's can create instances of a form in the repository, in which case the instance data is stored in the osp_node_metadata.

form instances are stored in the file system.

matrices
--------
osp_scaffolding tables contain the definition and structure of a matrix
osp_matrix and osp_reflection tables contain the instance data

matrix owner    = homer
matrix criteria = matrix rows = 7
matrix levels   = matrix cols = 3                                    45401AAE26E7E4313ED1530694F42F82

osp_scaffolding.id                  = 27E3D79C206E2B5EDCF9DBE789ACB8B1     ->      osp_matrix_tool.scaffolding_id
osp_matrix_tool.id                  = E77CA7E408F3CB6DB76C7F058BE8656F     ->      osp_matrix.matrixTool_id
osp_matrix.id                       = 6BAC4E359E9BDAF6701F8DD12A2DA3BA     ->      osp_matrix_cell.matrix_id
osp_matrix_cell.reflection_id       = CD3E1D28C379381B7BD4708A43DF325C     ->      osp_reflection.id
                                      5690BBF7ECFC5E2AF920E02E824B33B2     ->

osp_reflection_item.expectation_id  = DB57FB6564D66E8A5FB5334E74F8E9DD     ->      osp_expectation.elt
                                      47EA5DAA6488E633530412E443DD1DB6
osp_reflection_item.connectText     = expectation connect  text
osp_reflection_item.evidence        = expectation evidence text
osp_cell_attachment                 = non-form uploaded files (like word docs, images, excel files, etc)

osp_reflection      table - contains intellectual growth statement
osp_reflection_item table - contains expectation 1 - connect
osp_reflection_item table - contains expectation 1 - evidence

osp_matrix_cell.id                  =                                      -> osp_reviewer_item.cell_id


in osp 2.0, matrix outline data is stored in the 'properties' column in the osp_presentation table.
in sakai 2.5, matrix outlines are stored in a form called 'Portfolio Properties'.

presentation
------------
presentations are based on a presentation template, whose information is stored in the osp_presentation_template table.
the data (forms) needed by a presentation is specified by entries in the osp_presentation_item_def table.
the osp_presentation_template.renderer has the id of the xslt file residing in the repository that is used to render
presentations (instances of the presentation template).
when a user creates a presentation, an entry is created in the osp_presentation table.
the osp_presentation_item table contains entries for the data used in the presentation instance.
osp_presentation_item.presentation_id    -> osp_presentation.id
osp_presentation_item.item_definition_id -> osp_presentation_item_def.id
osp_presentation_item.artifact_id        -> osp_node_metadata.id   for fileArtifacts    (forms)
                                         -> osp_tree_node          for repository items (uploaded files)
